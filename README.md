### About

Kingsley Victor is a full-stack software engineer :man_technologist: with a burning passion for technology. While he's not coding, he's dabbling in philosophy or playing video games. 

He is open to learning new things (reasonable, rational, non-woke things). Take time to go through his contributions and be the judge (whether or not you think it matters in the grand scheme of things.)
